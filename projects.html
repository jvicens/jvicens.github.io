								<p><a href="https://www.ai4drought.com/">AI4Drought</a> is a project that builds upon a comprehensive approach combining Artificial Intelligence,
									dynamical seasonal climate prediction systems, and multiple Earth Observation products. This project aims
									to improve drought prediction capabilities and enrich our understanding of droughts’ causes, evolution, and
									consequences at seasonal time scales. AI4Drought aims to become a milestone achievement in the generation of
									actionable knowledge on the relationship between Earth Observation long-term data records and modelled climate
									variables through innovative multi-scaled AI approaches.
									<br><br>
									Our main contribution in AI4Drought is to analyse both lines of work (AI-models and EO-based models) with eXplainable AI (XAI)
									techniques in order to provide interpretability of the data-driven models and generate trust in the corresponding results making
									possible to confirm existing knowledge; to challenge existing knowledge and to generate new assumptions in the field of climate sciences.

									This project has received funding from <a href="https://eo4society.esa.int/projects/ai4drought/">ESA</a> (European Space Agency)</p>

                                    <p>Human mobility is one of the main proxies for modeling the spreading of epidemics. One of the most important non-pharmaceutical interventions during epidemic outbreaks is the limitation of mobility with the objective to reduce the number of contacts and tackle the virus transmission. However,  the application of actual mobility measures is affected by a large number of variables (social, cultural, economic, geographic, and so) and at different scales, from household to nation. This research project is aimed to understand mobility patterns that emerge during the pandemic at the urban scale from a social perspective, with special emphasis on the social implications of public policies.</p>

We propose a classic social dilemma based on cooperative game theory focus on the negotiations to deal with climate change. In this project, we use Citizen Social Lab platform to collect citizens' interactions and participatory science principles to engage citizens in participation. The main experiment was performed at DAU festival, where 324 individuals contributed to their actions. The outlines of the experiment published in PlosOne revealed that inequalities around climate change negotiations are tougher on individuals, societies, and organizations with few resources, who are, at the same time, the ones that show higher cooperation levels in relative terms. The platform, scientific results, data, and codes are publicly available following the open science principles.</p>
