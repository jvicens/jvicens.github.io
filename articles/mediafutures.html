								<p><a href="https://mediafutures.eu" target="_blank">MediaFutures</a> is an H2020 project whose main goal is building a European data innovation hub, including funding, mentoring, and support for entrepreneurial and creative projects to reshape the media value chain through responsible, innovative uses of data.</p>
								<p>The projects aims to: (a) explore the critical factors that impact how people engage with bottom-up quality journalism, science education and digital citizenship; (b) define a participatory, inclusive innovation programme, leveraging impulses from multiple disciplines, as well as synergies between entrepreneurs and creatives; (c) organise a competition addressing pressing technical, economic and societal challenges in the media value chain to identify promising digital entrepreneurs, creatives and data-empowered solutions; (d) provide data and experimentation facilities for the winners of this competition to test and nurture their ideas; (e)support 51 businesses and 43 artists by solving common concerns around funding and access to mentoring in technical, legal, business, media and sustainability matters; and (f) create toolkits and best practices for innovators, creatives, and other stakeholders to achieve greater traction for their citizen-centric initiatives, and empower them to communicate through data in inspiring, informative and engaging ways.</p>
								<p>Our main contribution from <a href="https://eurecat.org/es/ambitos-de-conocimiento/big-data/" target="_blank">Eurecat</a> is to make a wide catalogue of open data resources and free open source technologies for data exploitation available. This includes datasets and tools for data collection, exploration and exploitation produced by the project's partners, as well as publicly available resources.  Besides, we provide active support of non-technical aspects as well as experiment design and methodology to ensure valid and reliable results from the engagement with data from different sources including social media platforms, citizen science projects, open government and participative democracy platforms, etc.</p>
								<p>The consortium is formed by the following partners: <a href="https://www.zabala.es/">Zabala</a>, <a href="https://theodi.org/" target="_blank">Open Data Institute</a>, <a href="https://www.southampton.ac.uk/" target="_blank">University of Southampton</a>, <a href="https://www.ircam.fr/">IRCAM</a>, <a href="https://eurecat.org/es/ambitos-de-conocimiento/big-data/" target="_blank">Eurecat</a>, <a href="https://www.uni-hannover.de/" target="_blank">Leibniz Universität Hannover</a>, <a href="https://nma.vc/" target="_blank">Next Media Accelerator</a>, <a href="https://www.luiss.it/" target="_blank">LUISS</a>, <a href="https://www.kuleuven.be/" target="_blank">KU Leuven</a> and <a href="http://www.den-institute.org/" target="_blank">Design Entrepreneurship Institute</a>. This project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 innovation action programme under grant agreement No. <a href="https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/951962" target="_blank">951962</a>.</p>
