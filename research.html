							My research so far is focused on developing and applying computational algorithms to a large variety of topics. In particular, it has been concentrated on three main areas, the study of the decision-making process and human behaviour, the use of machine learning algorithms to study and unveil patterns in social phenomena, and the development of technological systems to perform participatory research and citizen science. <br><br>

							Currently, my multidisciplinary work bridge: complex social systems, human-computer interaction, machine learning and citizen science, and my research interests line in: <br><br>

							<b>I. Urban Systems and Social Justice.</b> Designing algorithms to model urban systems from a data-driven approach, tackling issues such as data and algorithmic bias. Studying phenomenon like gentrification and related effects, such as displacement of residents and housing market impact; segregation and integration of vulnerable collectives;  gender-based inequalities in urban contexts such as mobility patterns and labour market, or public health and sustainability in relation to urban ecosystems, collective behaviour, environmental health, and socio-economic factors. <br><br>

							<b>II. Human Behaviour and Social Interactions.</b> Researching to better understand human behaviours facing collective-risks, the effects of the ubiquitous inequalities among individuals and the sustainability of cooperation to increase social welfare. Characterizing interactions in social networks and participatory platforms, analysing phenomenons such as spreading of misinformation and fake news or the influence in public opinion of autonomous agents and social media bots. <br><br>

							<b>III. Citizen Participation in Science.</b> Designing participatory projects and platforms to incentive the involvement of citizens in science and other participatory actions. Following the principles of open research culture: transparency, openness and reproducibility in order to help the community to evaluate, critique, reuse and extend this research by means of open platforms, open datasets, open codes, and open publications. <br><br>

							Transvesally, I’m interested in the analysis and visualization of data for evidence-based decision-making and the relationship among science, technology, education and the arts.

									<p>The book «<a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-58278-4">The Science of Citizen Science</a>» has been finally published with the contribution of over a hundred authors. Personally, I contributed to the chapter <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-58278-4_10">«Machine Learning in Citizen Science: Promises and Implications»</a> in which we delve into the application of machine learning in citizen science and into the collaboration between citizens and machines to solve complex problems fairly. In addition to that, I participated in other projects presented in the chapters <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-58278-4_7">«Citizen Social Science: New and Established Approaches to Participation in Social Research»</a>  and <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-58278-4_11">«Participation and Co-creation in Citizen Science»</a>.<br><br>

									This book covers all aspects, including the strengths and barriers, that are relevant to fulfill the many expectations of citizen science. It is a wonderful conclusion to four years of intensive exchange and cooperation within a European research network on citizen science in the context of <a href="https://cs-eu.net/">COST Action 15212: Citizen Science to promote creativity, scientific literacy, and innovation throughout Europe</a>.</p>

									<p>Cooperation in hyper-social spaces is highly conditioned by the gender of the interacting individuals. This experiment, carried out at Fira de Tàrrega in 2017, measures the willingness of people to cooperate, pairing them to take part in the prisoner's dilemma game, outdoors and in the context of an artistic performance. This experiment, performed using participatory research and citizen science principles, shed light on how the other’s gender identity is a relevant factor in terms of cooperation and trust. In hyper-social scenarios, individuals show a pro-social behaviour, especially women, who exhibit high levels of cooperation, trust and ability to guess the others’ behaviour. The complete research paper «<a href="">Gender-based pairings influence cooperative expectations and behaviours</a>» is publicly available in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-57749-6">Scientific Reports</a> and co-authored with <a href="https://twitter.com/anna_cigarini">Anna Cigarini</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/josperello">Josep Perelló</a>.</p>

									<p><a href="https://github.com/CitizenSocialLab" target="_blank">Citizen Social Lab</a> is a digital platform used to perform behavioural experiments in the wild following the principles of citizen science. This platform collects data from the interaction between individuals who face a varied set of social dilemmas (public goods games, prisoner’s dilemma, trust game...). The platform is analysed with detail in the paper «<a href="documents/Vicens2018b.pdf" target="_blank">Citizen Social Lab: A Digital Platform for Human Behaviour Experimentation Within a Citizen Science Framework</a>» published in <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0207219" target="_blank">PlosOne</a> with data of more than two thousand individuals participating in experiments in the public space.

									<p>Mental disorders have an enormous impact in our society. In «<a href="./documents/Cigarini2018.pdf" target="_blank">Quantitative account of social interactions in a mental health care ecosystem: cooperation, trust and collective action</a>» we present the results of a suite of games that allow us to probe into different behavioral traits of the mental health care community role groups by means of citizen science practices. The evidence reinforces the idea of community social capital, with caregivers and professionals playing a leading role. Yet, the cost of collective action is mainly supported by individuals with a mental condition - which unveils their vulnerability. We finally point to the conditions under which cooperation among members of the ecosystem is better sustained, suggesting how virtuous cycles of inclusion and participation can be promoted in a "care in the community" framework. This <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-21900-1" target="_blank">research paper</a> was co-authored with <a href="" target="_blank">Anna Cigarini</a>, <a href="https://scholar.google.es/citations?hl=es&user=uE_0ZasAAAAJ" target="_blank">Josep Perelló</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=4a3L2hEAAAAJ&hl=es" target="_blank">Anxo Sanchez</a>.</p>
