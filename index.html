										We demonstrate that citizen science contributes to the effort
										to lower air pollution in urban areas providing evidences by citizen for
										performing community action and policies to tackle the problem. At the same

										measurements helps to scientist to provide air quality models and health
										impact assessments.
										<br><br>
										Furthermore, the air quality data jointly with social data allows to perform
										analysis about the environmental inequalities in urban areas, and
										ultimately the social impact of pollution. You can find the code

										New research paper focused on our work on public libraries and
										citizen science in two projects: «Citizen Science Laboratory» and «Citizen
										Science in Action». The paper
										entitled <a

								«Public libraries embrace citizen science: strengths and challenges»</a> is openly
										available in the journal <b>"Library & Information Science Research"</b>.
										Some of the highlighted results are: public libraries can offer leadership in the
										promotion and implementation of citizen science initiatives; citizen
										science helps to attract new users, increase social cohesion, and improve
										perceptions of a library's social value; and citizen science encourages users
										to address science-based community issues alongside scientists.<br><br>

                                    <p>Human mobility is one of the main proxies for modeling the spreading of epidemics. One of the most important non-pharmaceutical interventions during epidemic outbreaks is the limitation of mobility with the objective to reduce the number of contacts and tackle the virus transmission. However,  the application of actual mobility measures is affected by a large number of variables (social, cultural, economic, geographic, and so) and at different scales, from household to nation. This research project is aimed to understand mobility patterns that emerge during the pandemic at the urban scale from a social perspective, with special emphasis on the social implications of public policies.</p>

									<p>Cooperation in hyper-social spaces is highly conditioned by the gender of the interacting individuals. This experiment, carried out at Fira de Tàrrega in 2017, measures the willingness of people to cooperate, pairing them to take part in the prisoner's dilemma game, outdoors and in the context of an artistic performance. This experiment, performed using participatory research and citizen science principles, shed light on how the other’s gender identity is a relevant factor in terms of cooperation and trust. In hyper-social scenarios, individuals show a pro-social behaviour, especially women, who exhibit high levels of cooperation, trust and ability to guess the others’ behaviour. The complete research paper «<a href="documents/Cigarini2020.pdf" target="_blank">Gender-based pairings influence cooperative expectations and behaviours</a>» is publicly available in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-57749-6" target="_blank">Scientific Reports</a> and co-authored with <a href="https://twitter.com/anna_cigarini" target="_blank">Anna Cigarini</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/josperello" target="_blank">Josep Perelló</a>.</p>

									<p>Mental disorders have an enormous impact in our society. In «<a href="./documents/Cigarini2018.pdf" target="_blank">Quantitative account of social interactions in a mental health care ecosystem: cooperation, trust and collective action</a>» we present the results of a suite of games that allow us to probe into different behavioral traits of the mental health care community role groups by means of citizen science practices. The evidence reinforces the idea of community social capital, with caregivers and professionals playing a leading role. Yet, the cost of collective action is mainly supported by individuals with a mental condition - which unveils their vulnerability. We finally point to the conditions under which cooperation among members of the ecosystem is better sustained, suggesting how virtuous cycles of inclusion and participation can be promoted in a "care in the community" framework.

									<p>«<a href="https://www.cccb.org/en/activities/file/xair/228302" target="_blank">xAire</a>» is a project that proposes a collective measurement of air quality in Barcelona, particularly monitoring air pollution by nitrogen dioxide (NO2), one of the most important pollutants in the city. This project brings together twenty schools in the city of Barcelona from ten districts to install more than 800 sensors that will help to provide a more accurate mapping of air quality in the city. This project is carried out on <a href="https://www.cccb.org/en/seasons/file/city-station/227726" target="">The City Station</a>, a pop-up environmental health clinic built in the public space that put emphasis on the collective research and public participation in science.  This project is possible thanks to the sponsorship of <a href="https://dkvintegralia.org/" target="_blank">DKV</a> and <a href="http://www.4sfera.com/" target="_blank">4sfera</a> and to the collaboration of <a href="https://mweek.com/" target="_blank">Mobile Week Barcelona</a>, <a href="https://www.isglobal.org/" target="_blank">ISGlobal</a>, <a href="https://mappingforchange.org.uk/" target="_blank">Mapping for Change</a>, <a href="http://www.ub.edu/opensystems/" target="_blank">OpenSystems</a>, and the participation of 20 schools in Barcelona. The City Station is part of CCCB's exhibition «<a href="https://www.cccb.org/en/exhibitions/file/after-the-end-of-the-world/224747" target="_blank">After the end of the world</a>».</p>

									<p>«Natural Patterns» is a project that delves into the relationship between Science and Nature. By means of a system that promotes the observation of Nature as a canvas to present the research process, we are able to unveil the implications of science in the formation of patterns and their impact, beyond natural science, in art, design, architecture or music.</p>

									<p>Lab-in-the-field experiment in which 541 individuals face four different dyadic games with the aim of establishing general behavioral rules dictating individuals’ actions. By analyzing the observations of these simple social situations using machine learning algorithms, we find that a majority of the subjects conform, with a large degree of consistency, to a limited number of behavioral phenotypes: envious, optimist, pessimist, and trustful. The complete results are publised in <a href="http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/2/8/e1600451" target="_blank">Science Advances</a>.</p>

									<p>«The Climate Game» is a pop-up experiment that allows us to study how individuals cooperate to face a collective risk such as climate change. We propose a classic social dilemma based on cooperative game theory focus on the negotiations to deal with climate change. In this project, we use Citizen Social Lab platform to collect citizens' interactions and participatory science principles to engage citizens in participation. The main experiment was performed at DAU festival, where 324 individuals contributed to their actions. The outlines of the experiment published in PlosOne revealed that inequalities around climate change negotiations are tougher on individuals, societies, and organizations with few resources, who are, at the same time, the ones that show higher cooperation levels in relative terms. The platform, scientific results, data, and codes are publicly available following the open science principles.</p>

									<p>«Museum Night Experiment» is a citizen science experiment created to observe, capture and analyze the "cultural behaviour" of attendants to «La Nit dels Museus» in Barcelona («Museums at Night»).  The main objective is to analyse the patterns generated by citizens when massively visiting museums and cultural centers in order to understand participation profiles and establish a more efficient relationship between citizens, cultural equipments and the city.</p>

									<p>This project was part of my Engineering Thesis focused on the design and development of a natural user inteface and a tridimensional audio system. The thesis was based in previous works in <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/1731903.1731906" target="_blank">human computer interaction</a> and audio processing. The final artifact creates a sound experience by means of a system that reacts in real-time to the fiducials placed on a table-top user interface. Each fiducial corresponds to a particular sound represented in a tridimensional environment created on a natural user interface working with <a href="https://www.tuio.org/" target="_blank">TUIO</a> protocols.</p>
